# Operators (Instead of creating txt files you can learn to create MD files)

1. In print operation, if we use '+' operator for both addition and concatenation,
then it will follow L -> R convention
 System.out.print(j + 1 + " ");

2. In Arithetic opertaions it is know fact, that it will follow order of importance
if ( j+1 % 2 == 0 ), here first 1 % 2 will be performed first
